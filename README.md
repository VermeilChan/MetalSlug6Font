# MetalSlugFont

Create images with the iconic Metal Slug font style! Easily transform your text into visually appealing images reminiscent of the Metal Slug arcade game series. This tool allows you to generate images with a wide range of characters, numbers, and symbols.

#### **Note:** The web app is no longer actively maintained, and it might be down at anytime. However, if someone cannot use the terminal-based version, I may consider working on it again in the future.
